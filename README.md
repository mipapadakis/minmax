# minmax
A sorting algorithm called minmax, being compared with other famous sorting algorithms.
Concept: In each iteration, setFirst() the min values and setLast() the max values of the array.


VERSIONS:
First version: minmax1
Improved version: minmax2

The project runs a series of tests (Main.kt) and, for each test, prints the time elapsed for the minmax1 & minmax2 functions, as well as each of the famous algorithms. A conclusion from these results is that the minmax algorithm is comparable to (or even surpasses) some of the most efficient famous algorithms, in cases in which the array contains many instances of the same numbers, like: [5,4,1,2,5,2,4,3,1,5,4,2,1,5,3,1]


The algorithm can take several modifications and improvements. Algorithm explanation and various test results: check "results" folder in root dir.
